#Time Serious

## Time Serious is an [editors lab hackathon project](http://www.walkleys.com/editorslab/) which takes a data input, analyses it, and outputs a news report in natural language, with publication-ready graphics. [Here's the working - but buggy - demo](https://timeserious.herokuapp.com/).

### The problem

In a media environment where reporters have less time, journalists often have to write formulaic stories such as covering stories about the weather - how hot is it, is it a new record, or recurring stories like politician's expenses and donations - who spent the most, who are the top 5, was it more or less than last year. 

Reporters themselves want more time to work on deeper, more meaningful stories - like why the climate is changing, which politicians are abusing the expenses system. There is a strong public benefit in these stories.

One thing that many of these formulaic, recurring stories have in common is that they involve data, often time series data. In surveying just the last week of stories in a small section of our own site, we found at least five such examples. Economic figures, polling figures, emissions data, and weather data.

### The solution

So, our pitch was to build a system that can automate the analyse, writing, and production of graphics for these stories. Data in, news story out. 

While similar things have been built before, as far as we know these systems are either proprietary and closed, or they've been built for specific data input, like earthquakes or sport stats. Ours will be open source and data agnostic.

For our demo, all you need to do is pop the data into the Google sheet and enter some key variables.

Once you input the variables and the data source, you can tell the program to build the news report.

Some people have joked that we’re making our reporters redundant. We’re really not. What we’re doing is solving a major newsroom problem. We’re keeping editors happy, because they get their story about how hot it is, and faster than the competition. We’re keeping journalists happy, because they get the chance to spend that little bit more time digging into the data they really want to look it and going beyond the surface.

And we’re in turn providing a better news product for our readers, who get the benefit of the formula driven news stories and the deeper and more meaningful investigations our reporters want to work on.

It also has the added benefit of taking the hassle out of data analysis and graphic production.
